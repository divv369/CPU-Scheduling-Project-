# CPU Scheduling Visual Simulator

A web-based interactive simulator designed to visualize and analyze classical CPU Scheduling algorithms used in Operating Systems.

This project implements multiple scheduling strategies and dynamically displays process execution using Gantt charts and performance metrics.

---

## Overview

The simulator allows users to input process details such as Arrival Time and Burst Time, select a scheduling algorithm, and observe how processes are executed over time.

It computes and displays key scheduling metrics including Completion Time, Waiting Time, and Turnaround Time, along with a graphical Gantt chart representation.
